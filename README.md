# odin-recipes
My first project for the Odin Project;

This project will demonstrate my mastery of foundational HTML and put together the information I have learned from The Odin Project, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Mimo.

The aim of the project is to use HTML in order to write a recipe. I will be using photos, ordered lists, undordered lists, and HTML5 structure in order to do this.

I have not had much time with CSS so this project will look incredibly brutalist, more brutalist than the DC metro.

Enjoy!
