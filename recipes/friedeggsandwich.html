    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There is nothing in the world I love more than grilling a sandwich. Whether it be a grilled cheese or a panini, warm bread with a gooey center is a definite comfort food. Here you will find the recipe for a delicious, fried-egg sandwich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chipotle in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 slice bacon, halved</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ketchup and chipotle and spread on the inside of each piece of bread.F</li>
        <li>Place the cheese between the bread at an angle so that the edges hangover the sides of the bread.</li>
        <li>Butter the outside of one bread slice with half the butter. Heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Press the sandwich on, buttered-side down. Press until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has started to melt.</li>
        <li>Butter the other side (which is facing up) with the remaining butter and flip. Cook until golden brown and the cheese is gooey, this should all take 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the sandwich from the heat and hold.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a pan over medium heat, cook the bacon until barely crisp, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the bacon, pushing the two pieces next to each other to form a square.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg on top, cooking into the bacon. Continue cooking until the egg is set, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open up the sandwich (use a spoon to help pull apart the bread) and slide in the eggs and bacon.</li>
        <li>Close up, slice and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
